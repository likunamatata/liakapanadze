                As an economics nerd, Iâ€™m a big fan of measuring things and making complex simple. At the same time, I am well aware of differences between real life and mathematical models. My value add in most environments is curiosity, persistence, and intellectual humility.

              I made this website to show off my CSS skills <b>AND ALSO</b> to build and share a library of resources related to revenue growth and operations. I hope you have fun scrolling through the (Re)Blog section. Sometime in the future, I plan to also start creating original content on the subject and I will cleverly name it the Blog section, stay tuned!
